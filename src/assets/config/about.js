            "My journey as a developer started when I was still in college, I started learning Python, it was my first programming language. Then my attention completely moved to websites development. I always studied everything by myself and when I visited some interactive websites, I was always interested in how to create something similar or something better, it always amazed me how it was done and how can I do the same?",
            "While I was learning html css js at the same time I started to get interested in different builders such as Gulp and Webpack, made my own builds for development with different preprocessors for HTML and CSS, site optimization and more.",
            "When I realized that I wanted more, I found my first job, and at the same time I fulfilled my first orders. I began to actively study React, I have always been attracted to something interesting and difficult. Now I can easily create simple and difficult web applications using React and use different other technologies.",
            "Now I spend all my free time studying Web3, learning technologies like Solidity, Hardhat, Ethers, Metamask, Blockchain, creating smart contracts, deploying on Testnet/Localnet/Mainnet, testing and creating UI. Already had a chance to work with these technologies in practice. I want to become a professional in this area and contribute my small part in the development of this sphere."
