            "I started my development way when I was in college, I started learning Python, it was my first programming language. Then my attention completely moved to websites development. I always studied everything by myself, I was always interested in how to create websites, I always wondered how it was done and how can I do the same? when I visited some interactive websites.",
            "I started to learn frontend with html css js at the same time I started to get interested in different builders such as Gulp and Webpack, made my own builds for development with different preprocessors for html and css, site optimization and more.",
            "When I realized that I wanted more, I found my first job, and at the same time I fulfilled my first orders. I began to actively study React framework, I have always been attracted to something interesting and difficult. Now I can easily create simple and difficult web applications using React and use different other technologies.",
            "Now I spend all my free time studying web3, learning technologies like solidity, hardhat, ethers, metamask, writing smart contracts, working with blockchain, deploying on testnet/localnet/mainnet, testing and writing frontend for user interaction with smart contracts. Already had a chance to work with these technologies in practice. I want to become a professional in this area and contribute my small part in the development of this sphere."
